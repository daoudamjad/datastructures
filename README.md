Data Structures
==============

A data structures reference manual for Java engineers that "forget" how to use them.

Mostly this is for engineers and the layman that want an easy to read and use manual for data structures. I've found that most books that delve into the topic seem to make it either far too acedemic or complicated to read. On top of that it's code snippets where I find it's easier to learn with lots of teaching and full working code so that you can tinker.

The whole purpose of this is so that it's self referencing and easy to read. Most of the documentation will be inline. Function doc blocks will go into the overview of the code while in-function comments will, hopefully, make the code easier to understand as to what is intended to happen.

Currently there is nothing in here but I'll be updating over the week.
