# Start here

Data structres is at the core of ALL of computer science. If you don't know how, at the minimum, a stack, queue or something else works then you're not going to have a lot of fun doing the programming.

We won't be stopping there though. We plan to not go over the core data structures that we all need to know we'll go over a few other topics as well. 
* Algorithms design & analysis
* Code smells
* Programming styles & refactoring
* Design patterns
* Fun algorithms
* When to use your data structure. 

Those were in no particular order. Sorry about that.

As for data structures that we'll be doing here this list is as follows (also in no particular order)
* Arrays
* Simple Sorting
* Stacks
* Queues
* Linked Lists
* Recursion
* Advanced Sorting
* Binary Trees
* Red-black trees
* 2-3-4 trees
* Hash tables
* Heaps
* Graphs
* Weighted graphs

I hope this is as fruitful for you as it will be for us. Unfortunatlly though we won't be able to assign you credit or a degree.

If you found it useful we would LOVE to hear from you. If there are issues, things we missed, spelling issues, (gasp) grammer issues, something doens't grok with something else, mistake in slang use, you found it useful OR you are using it in your class then tell us in the issue queue.
